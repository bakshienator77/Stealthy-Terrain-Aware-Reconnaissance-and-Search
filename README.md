## Anonymous Repo for Stealthy Terrain-Aware Multi-Agent Active Search

This repo has been anonymized and hence may not be runnable.\

Dependencies are ROS1 and python2.7 with numpy, matplotlib and PIL.\

More detailed instructions to follow to recreate experiments.\

The main code for STAR, GUTS, RSI, COVERAGE and RANDOM policies tested for adversarial multi agent active search in this paper can be found written in src/recon/src/waypoint_planner/src/waypoint_planner/NATS.py.
